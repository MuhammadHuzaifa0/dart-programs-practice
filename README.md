# Beginner Level Dart Programming Exercises

This repository contains a set of beginner-level programming exercises in Dart, intended to help learners practice foundational Dart concepts. Each exercise is designed to target a specific aspect of the Dart programming language, from handling data types and collections to object-oriented programming.

## Getting Started

To run these exercises, you'll need to have Dart installed. You can follow the official Dart [installation guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart) if Dart is not already set up on your machine.

Clone this repository and navigate to the folder of each exercise to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dart-beginner-exercises.git
cd dart-beginner-exercises
```

Each exercise can be executed by running the Dart file directly:

```bash
dart exercise_file.dart
```

## Exercise List

Below is a summary of each exercise:

1. **Command Line Arguments**  
   Write a program that takes command-line arguments (string, integer, decimal) and performs specific actions based on the data type.

2. **List Sorting**  
   Create and sort a list of records by name and age.

3. **List Initialization**  
   Transform an initial list of integers into a new format with formatted strings.

4. **Sum List Elements**  
   Calculate the sum of a list without using loops or direct indexing.

5. **Swap Two Numbers**  
   Swap two numbers without using a third variable or any arithmetic/logical operators.

6. **Grade Switch-Case**  
   Implement a grade calculator using a switch-case based on predefined grade ranges.

7. **Map Sorting**  
   Sort a list of maps by position and name.

8. **Filter Records by Condition**  
   Print records from a list of maps based on specific age and name conditions.

9. **Function with Named Parameters**  
   Define a function using named parameters and demonstrate its use.

10. **Arrow Functions for Equations**  
    Implement various equations using arrow functions.

11. **Nested Arrow Functions**  
    Solve equations that require nested arrow functions.

12. **Nested Arrow Functions with Conditions**  
    Implement nested arrow functions with specific conditions to solve a multi-variable equation.

13. **List Transformation with Map and forEach**  
    Capitalize and append text to list elements using map and forEach.

14. **Calculator using Typedefs**  
    Create a basic calculator with functions for add, subtract, multiply, and divide using typedef.

15. **Display Map Array Elements**  
    Display the keys and values of an array of maps.

16. **Append Arrays**  
    Append one array to another using Dart list operations.

17. **Modify Object Property**  
    Use spread syntax to modify a Dart object property.

18. **Arrow Function within Arrow Function**  
    Demonstrate an example of nesting one arrow function within another.

19. **Class Inheritance (Person, Student, Teacher)**  
    Create a class hierarchy with `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher`, with specific attributes for each.

20. **Filter Students with Conditions**  
    Use `where` and `forEach` to print specific student records based on conditions.

21. **Filter Students by Age and Name**  
    Filter and display student details based on age and name conditions using `where` and `forEach`.
